This is a repo consisting of algorithms and data structures that I've implemented in Java.

Every .java file deals with a different interview question.

The goal of putting this online is to make common implementations of interview questions

available to the general public. I'm also making this project open source, so I accept contributions.

### Contributing

The general rule is that your code has to solve a common interview question. The guideline for a common

question is the book 'Cracking the Coding Interview' by Gayle McDowell which you can find [here.] (https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850)


I don't accept pull request for very specialized algorithms and data structures. In case you're not sure

whether you should contribute certain code, discuss it with me in the Issue Tracker by opening a new Issue.
